    <h3>What is Instanssi?</h3>
    <p>
        Instanssi is a festival of digital making in Jyväskylä, Finland. It is organized 9.-11.3.2011 
        at Voionmaan lukio. Instanssi is meant to be a beginner friendly event, which everyone who is interested 
        in digital culture can visit and enjoy. Instanssi offers workshops, presentations and friendly creative
        environment. This year we concentrate especially on open data. Unfortunately most of the page is currently
        only available in Finnish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Competitions at Instanssi include demo, 4k demo, music, graphic, fast graphic, scraping of open data, 
        Robocode and random, in which the point is to make a confusing entry any way you like. One of the 
        specialties of Instanssi are the programmable lights, which can be used as a part of the entries.
