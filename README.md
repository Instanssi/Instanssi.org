Instanssi.org website project
=============================

This is the website of instanssi.org demoparty. It contains the main website (main20xx),
Kompomaatti (our compo entry management interface), and Arkisto (our entry archive site). Most
of the comments and language used is in Finnish, because the programmers weren't interested in 
internationalization :D

This project has been originally developed for Instanssi 2012. Project is still alive and current development
focus is to provide web site for Instanssi 2024.
